5th edition DnD Character Builder

This project has a few purposes: 1) to learn java by building something I want. 2) to create an application that produces playable 5th edition DnD Characters 3) To learn to use Git to work on the project at home and talk about it with the rest of Team Awesome.

This readme has been enhanced with flavor crystals.
